# Flat Steam UI - Oswald
Based on the amazing **Flat Steam UI** custom style sheet by [Denis G](https://github.com/denis-g/), this fork swaps out the default font for a more condensed font, Oswald. It started as a simple personal modification of the original Flat Steam UI, but has also expanded to include some other enhancements created along the way. 

Please note, this is was a personal passiong project and is considered a perpetual work-in -progress.

## Legacy
The original Flat Steam UI was created many years ago by Denis G in an effort to beautify the Steam website with a modern design. The original descriprion boasted: "Flat, clean and simply Steam Store and Community redesign. More squared and geometry-focused flat design, global UI and style fixes, and new modern vision. Make your Steam better!" Please visit the original repo for more information and examples.
